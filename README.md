Lifofinn is more than just another code editor, but a highly scriptable text editor, have significant mood lighting features, easily scripting the editor with almost any imagined functions with your favourite programming languages. Instantly interact programming environment, checking syntax errors, compile and runtime errors immediately and fast jumping to error lines, while writing, debugging and refactoring your code, immediately test, run and deploy from within the editor. Use as a stream based component like traditional Unix command line utility and programmingly used as a structured text editor, run non-interactively as a file system and text manipulation tool. Full programmable text editor, syntax highlighting, code runner, code formatter and debugger for almost any programming language, edit files with the power of scripting languages!

Lifofinn, serious-small and friendly code editor, code runner and debugger, aka. LFF, pronounced [Ðµlf-fi], the name means a fire bird that can rebirth and rise again from the ashes, or a joke meaning, Lifo-finn, a Finnish last in, and first out with a subtle scorn. This tiny dev tool was originally developed to provide a native scripting language debugging environment that seamlessly integrated with C and C++, designedly made for Lua and mruby development at the beginning. After years of development, since 2019, this gumption editor already supports debugging code for almost any programming language. An extremely small code editor is the design goal of Lifofinn to pursue, and also the design philosophy of this unique efficient utility. This app is designed for efficient programming, makes programming feels light, simple and free. It not only has an efficient code navigation and call routines tracing ability but also has a very flexible design that helps user to extend it to support special developing requirements in a comfortable and efficient way.
